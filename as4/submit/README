The code was written/tested on a Macbook running 10.7, and was also compiled/tested on the cory/star machines. We used the FreeImage library and the algebra3.h library (though we edited the latter to facilitate calculations with homogenized vec4).

All of the images are in the subdirectory "images," and they were generated from the scene files in the "tests" directory. To generate each image, run "./as4 tests/$file" where $file is the name of the test file.
