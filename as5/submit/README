Raytracer

The code was written/tested on a Macbook running 10.7, and was also compiled/tested on the cory/star machines and the Hive machines. We used the FreeImage library and the algebra3.h library (though we edited the latter to facilitate calculations with homogenous vec4).

All of the images are in the subdirectory "images," and they were generated from the scene files in the "tests" directory. To generate each image, run "./as5 tests/$file" where $file is the name of the test file.

Image "ellipse.png" shows an arbitrarily rotated and scaled ellipsoid with proper shading. To produce this image, run ellipse.t

Image "poly.png" shows polygons (just triangles). To reproduce, run poly.t

"img1.png" shows phong shading and shadows
run 1.t

"img3.png" shows reflections nicely
run 3.t

All of these images display linear transformations on objects.

img1.png contains both point and directional lights. There is a directional light coming from below, and a point light in the top right.

The "print" command in our .t files prints out the image as a .png, if that command is missing a GLUT window is opened.

img5.png and img7.png were generated using a python script, and are fun.

img6.png demonstrates reflections in a more simple environment. run 6.t
