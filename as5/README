makefile makes for solaris, and was tested on star
makefile.osx makes for osx

The code was written/tested on a Macbook running 10.7, and was also compiled/tested on the cory/star machines and the Hive machines. We used the FreeImage library and the algebra3.h library (though we edited the latter to facilitate calculations with homogenous vec4).

All of the images are in the subdirectory "images," and they were generated from the scene files in the "tests" directory. To generate each image, run "./as5 tests/$file $1 $2" where $file is the name of the test file. $2 is optional ("-a" specifies adaptive subdivision). $1 is the parameter for uniform subdivision if adaptive is not set, and the acceptable error bound for adaptive subdivision if adaptive *is* set.

Each of the image titles should be sufficiently descriptive of what we rendered.

The "teacup" model is a model I found here: http://www.holmes3d.net/graphics/teapot/
